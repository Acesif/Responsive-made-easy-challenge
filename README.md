# Responsive Website Challenge

## This is a responsive website challenge I found in the Kevin Powell Youtube channel and I decide to give it a go.

Visit the live site: [here](https://acesif.github.io/Responsive-made-easy-challenge/)

You can try out the challenge for yourself by trying to imitate the design given from [here](flexbox-challenge-4.pdf)

If you need help with the tutorial of this project, you can follow [Kevin's tutorial](https://youtu.be/bn-DQCifeQQ) on this
